<p></p>1. Select the Z axis on the orientation figure, it is the blue cone with Z.
<p></p>1.a. Press "Pers" below the orientation figure to switch to isometric view for more precision. Optional step.
<p></p>1.b. On the upper part of the viewport, next to the Pivot tab, make sure it is in "Global"
<p></p>2. In the GameObjects tab, select 3D Object, then Cube.
<p></p>3. Quickly rename the cube "Roof" before clicking anything.
<p></p>4. Elongate the roof cube using the scale tool found at the upper-left corner of the viewport.
<p></p>4.a. To elongate the cube while in front view, click and hold the red square, then stretch the cube to your desired roof length.
<p></p>5. Use the rotate tool, above the scale tool's button, to rotate the roof cube so that it is in a slanted position. You may use the Z rotation on the transform tab to quickly set the roof on a 35, 45, or desired degree angle.
<p></p>6. Press the gray cone on the other side of the red X cone to switch to Left v (-X view), then use the blue cube to extend the roof to your desired length. Not too long though.
<p></p>7. Return to front view with the blue Z cone, clock on the roof cube in the hierarchy tab, then press ctrl+D to duplicate the roof cube
<p></p>8. Rotate the second roof cube using the Transform panel; insert "180" on the Y section of Rotation
<p></p>9. With the red arrow, move the second roof to the left side until the two roofs form a seamless inverted V shape. Fine-tuning with the Transform panel is recommended
<p></p>10. With your roof done, add another cube in the GameObjects tab, and call this one "Wall"
<p></p>11. Use the green square of the scale tool to stretch this wall out. Make sure it isn't ass long as the roof.
<p></p>12. Place the wall near the lower end of one of the roof cubes, leaving part of the lower end of the roof hanging out (no more than a quarter).
<p></p>12.a. Make sure that the upper left corner of the wall cube is touching the roof cube, only clipping it a little.
<p></p>13. Switch back to Left view (-X view) and stretch the wall cube using the blue scale tool cube.
<p></p>13.a. It is ideal that both front and back ends of the house aren't as long as the roof.
<p></p>14. Copy the wall using ctrl+D on the hierarchy tab, then drag it with the red arrow until it touches the other roof cube. 
<p></p>15 Copy any one of the walls, drag it near the approximate center of your house with the red move arrow, then, int he Transform tab, give it a Y rotation value of 90.
<p></p>16. Switch to Left or Right view, then drag it to the back of the house.
<p></p>17. Scale it down so both ends of the wall are either just touching the side walls.
<p></p>17.a. Fine-tune with the Transform tab, the X value of Position
<p></p>17.b. Switch back into perspective view for better visibility, optional. 
<p></p>18. Duplicate the back wall and drag the duplicate to the front of the house.
<p></p>18.a. Make sure it is as flush as the back wall, fine tune with the Transform tab.
<p></p>19. Scale it down by dividing the X value by 3 in the X scale tab, then drag it towards one of the side walls in the X axis until just touching.
<p></p>19.a. Duplicate the wall, then move it to the other side wall.
<p></p>19.b. Duplicate the wall again, then place it at the center of the two smaller walls. You can do this by copying the X position of the back wall and pasting it on the new middle wall
<p></p>20. Scale down the middle wall to a third of its size using the Y scale tab on the Transform tab.
<p></p>21. Move the small wall up until it is flush with the other two small walls beside it.

 


And now you have a simple house design in Unity6
