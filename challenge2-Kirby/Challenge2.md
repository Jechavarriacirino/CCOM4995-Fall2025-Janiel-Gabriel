<h2>Making The Terrain</h2>
<h2>Making The Kirbys</h2>
<p>Before anything, it's recommended you find a reference image of the kind of Kirby you want to make. Kirby is simple to make, but it's always smart to have a reference when recreating somethign that doesn't exist. Before we start, observe the top toolbar, just below where it says "Scene, Game, Asset Store", go to the selectable box just under "Scene" and make sure it says Center, and that the box next to it says "Local". If not, click on them and change them to these settings. 
</p><p>There are many ways to make a Kirby and many ways to start, but for this, we used the method introduced in Kirby's Adventure for the Nintendo Entretainment System. It goes:</p>

<h3>"First you draw a Circle"</h3>
<p>1.Add a sphere game object</p>
<p>2.Add one more sphere, then scale it down to match Kirby's actual arm size</p>
<p>3.Taking into consideration our front is in the Z axis, place the arm on kirby's side (on the X axis)</p>
<p>4. Duplicate the arm, then place it on his other side on the X axis (Made easier while in top view)</p>

<h3>"Then you dot the eyes"</h3>
<p>5. Insert a capsule game object</p>
<p>6. Using the Scale or Transform tools, make sure the eye is:</p>
<p>a. Small but ovalled on the Y axis</p>
<p>b. Thin but still rounded on the X axis</p>
<p>c. Thin on the Z axis, with very little thickness</p>
<p>6.a. Always refer to your reference image if you're confused about the specific of your eyes or any other part.</p>
<p>7. Place the eye on either side of Kirby, above his mid-section, and according to your reference, then drag it into Kirby until it clips, but that all of the front of the eye is still visible.</p>
<p>8. Duplicate the eye and place it on the other side of Kirby's face, keeping symmetry as close as you can, matching your reference.</p>
<p>8.a. You may need to rotate the eyes individually for them to fit well.</p>


<h3>"Add a great big smile"</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, it's not easy making a great big smile with just primitives, so we will do the next best, and second most common, of Kirby's expressions, the 0.0 face.</p>
<p>9. Add a sphere game object</p>
<p>10. Like before, scale it thin on the Z axis, then scale it very slightly upward on the Y axis, but do not touch the X</p>
<p>11. On front view, using the gray box on the scale or transform tool, scale your sphere down until it is a small dot, but not extremely tiny</p>
<p>12. Place the dot mouth on Kirby's middle face, and below the eyes, clipping into his body all the while it is still very visible.</p>
<p>12.a. You may need to rotate the mouth for it to be a perfect fit on Kirby's face.</p>


<h3>"And presto, it's Kirby!"</h3>
<p>Kirby's shoes are not a shape we can achieve with only primitives, so we'll have to improvise more than last time. We will be using a heavily scaled capsule for this.</p>
<p>13. Insert a capsule game object</p>
<p>14. Rotate it 90 degrees on the X axis using the Transform Panel on the right side of the screen</p>
<p>15. Scale down the capsule uniformly with the gray cube of the scale/transform tool.</p>
<p>16. From here, tweak the scale and position to get it to a spot and shape that you find satisfying.</p>
<p>17.Select and drag every single primitive your kirby's made out of, except your body, into kirby's body on the Hierarchy panel on the left.</p>
<p>17.a. It should look like all objects, except the body, are indented. Test to see if the parenting worked by selecting and moving only the body</p>
<p>18. Select, drag, and drop the parented kirby model into the lower panel which has the asset folder on display. This will make it a prefab</p>
